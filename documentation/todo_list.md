## Things to do


### Documentation

* Wait for Jannis' article, incorporate some of the changes
* Add motivation to introduction
* Link data structure to code (perhaps 2d files instead of Xd?)
* Split multigrid description into own markdown file
* Split plasma fluid model into separate file, and replace it by the simpler
  model now included in the article
* Provide an overview of the available documentation in the main markdown file, to ease navigation
* Add references
