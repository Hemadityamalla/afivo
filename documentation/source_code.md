# About the source code

This folder `src` contains the source of Afivo, split over several modules. The
`m_aX_[...].f90` files contain code for both the 2D and 3D version. The
corresponding `m_a2_[...].f90` and `m_a3_[...].f90` files are generated
automatically, so you should **not** edit those! Instead, modify the
`m_aX_[...].f90` files.
